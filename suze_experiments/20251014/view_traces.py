Delete any one 'a', resulting string is \"aa\" which is a palindrome.\nExample case 2. It is not possible to delete exactly one character and having a palindrome.\nExample case 3. Delete 'c', resulting string is \"abdba\" which is a palindrome. \nExample case 4. Delete 'b', resulting string is \"aba\" which is a palindrome.\n"

      "content": "Looking at this problem, I need to determine if we can delete exactly one character from a string to make it a palindrome.\n\nMy approach:\n1. Try deleting each character one at a time\n2. Check if the resulting string is a palindrome\n3. If any deletion results in a palindrome, return \"YES\"\n4. If no deletion works, return \"NO\"\n\nLet me trace through the examples:\n- \"aaa\": Delete any 'a' \u2192 \"aa\" (palindrome) \u2713\n- \"abc\": Try all deletions \u2192 \"bc\", \"ac\", \"ab\" (none are palindromes) \u2717\n- \"abdbca\": Delete 'c' \u2192 \"abdba\" (palindrome) \u2713\n- \"abba\": Delete second 'b' \u2192 \"aba\" (palindrome) \u2713\n\nHere's my solution:\n\n```python\ndef is_palindrome(s):\n    return s == s[::-1]\n\ndef can_make_palindrome_by_deleting_one(s):\n    n = len(s)\n    # Try deleting each character\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Create string without character at index i\n        new_string = s[:i] + s[i+1:]\n        if is_palindrome(new_string):\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef solve():\n    t = int(input())\n    for _ in range(t):\n        s = input().strip()\n        if can_make_palindrome_by_deleting_one(s):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n\nWait, let me optimize this a bit. The current solution works but we can make it more efficient by using a two-pointer approach:\n\n```python\ndef is_palindrome(s):\n    return s == s[::-1]\n\ndef can_make_palindrome_by_deleting_one(s):\n    n = len(s)\n    # Try deleting each character\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Create string without character at index i\n        new_string = s[:i] + s[i+1:]\n        if is_palindrome(new_string):\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef solve():\n    t = int(input())\n    for _ in range(t):\n        s = input().strip()\n        if can_make_palindrome_by_deleting_one(s):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n\nActually, the straightforward approach should work fine for reasonable string lengths. Let me stick with the clear and correct solution:\n\n```python\ndef is_palindrome(s):\n    return s == s[::-1]\n\ndef can_make_palindrome_by_deleting_one(s):\n    # Try deleting each character one by one\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        # Create new string without character at index i\n        new_s = s[:i] + s[i+1:]\n        if is_palindrome(new_s):\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef solve():\n    t = int(input())\n    for _ in range(t):\n        s = input().strip()\n        if can_make_palindrome_by_deleting_one(s):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nsolve()\n```"
